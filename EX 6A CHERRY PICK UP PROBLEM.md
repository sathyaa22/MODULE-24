# EX 6A CHERRY PICK UP PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To Create a python program for the following problem statement.
You are given an n x n grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.
0	means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
1	means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.
Return the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below:
Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (n - 1, n - 1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1).
After reaching (n - 1, n - 1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells.
When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell 0. If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1), then no cherries can be collected.
